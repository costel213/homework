      <p>
        In each section you'll find an exercise you need to find a solution to.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can insert the solution in the container with the CSS class{" "}
        <i>solution-container</i>, by deleting the <i>i</i> tag
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have other ideas to organise the code, please just give some
        instructions to find the solution. In this case, you can use the
        README.md file
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer to find the solution on your repository on git. You can send me
        the link to your public repository, or you can give me access to a
        private one. <br />
        <i>
          Note: Please delete the node_modules folder before uploading the code
          on git
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Be creative with the solution. If you find multiple ones to a single
        exercise, I'll be happy to see them all.
